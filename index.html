        <p>“I am remarkable because… 
            <br>
    I take time every day to support my team members.” It felt like a small thing, but it's something I'm proud of nonetheless. It was the small step I needed to build to bigger things and give myself permission to talk about myself without apology.</p>

    <p>I am passionate about covering the skill gap needed to accelerate the growth and rise of Africa. Enabling people to do and achieve more through technology.</p>
